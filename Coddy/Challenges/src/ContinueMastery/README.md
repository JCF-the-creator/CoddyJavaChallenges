Challange:

You are printing a shopping list with item numbers, but you want to skip certain "unlucky" numbers (4, 13, and 17). Create a program that:

Prints items 1 through 20 in this exact format:

Item #1: Get this item!

Item #2: Get this item!

Item #3: Get this item!

When it reaches numbers 4, 13, or 17:

Print: Skipping unlucky number: [number]

Use continue to skip printing the regular item message

Continue to the next number

Example output for numbers 3-5:

Item #3: Get this item!

Skipping unlucky number: 4
Item #5: Get this item!
